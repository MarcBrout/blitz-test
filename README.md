## Subject Questions

* Which architecture would you implement for an MVP mobile app? Why?

  For a MVP I would implement a Clean Architecture. It's based on modular approach to separate business logic and implementations. It also greatly simplify testing and allow re-usability.

  Why ?

    - First and foremost, today's MVPs are not trashable anymore, they're the foundation for the real projects and directly upgrade to them.

    - Secondly, in a ever faster competitive industry, time to market, first to market have become more, if not most, crucial to start-ups. Re-doing a MVP just because of some mis-conception at the start is a huge time and money loss.

    - Finally, having a strong base allow for easier maintenance, easier velocity planning, less bug, easier testing, ect...

* Show us two apps on the store with great UI/UX and briefly tell us why.

  Tiktok - Short Video Social Network

    - Simplicity of use vs Complexity of features -> The more simple an application seems to be, the more thought and tests have been into it.
    - Intuitive navigation -> young target audience adaptation
    - Very low waiting times -> less friction
    - Pertinent and evolutive algorithm-based-feed of content -> it never stops.

  Yousician - Music Learning App

    - Incredible UX -> You can learn an instrument (guitare, piano, even singing) with an app that actually listen to your notes. You play at Guitar Hero (A video game) but for real. Very compelling and engaging experience.
    - The UI is modern
    - You can learn to play latest songs fairly quickly
    - You can accord your instrument through the app

  <b>(If you want to learn the guitar, or the piano, try it, seriously!)</b>
